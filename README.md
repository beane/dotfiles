There are my dotfiles. You are free to borrow from them as you like, since that's more or less what I've done. Remember to change your username, email, and root directory name in gitconfig and wherever else. Run the setup.sh script to - you guessed it - set up!

Here's a few lists of stuff I like to have on my machines.

Essentials:
  - Chrome - log in for the chrome extensions
  - Lastpass
  - [Divvy][divvy-link]
  - ~~Cloup App~~
    - Cloud App started charging :-(
  - Dropbox
  - ~~[Solarized][solarized-link]. I am now in love with solarized.~~
    - ~~For [sublime][sublime-solarized-link]~~
    - Edit: I am no longer in love with Solarized. It messed up sublime and the terminal.
