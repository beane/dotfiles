There are my dotfiles. You are free to borrow from them as you like, since that's more or less what I've done. Remember to change your username, email, and root directory name in gitconfig and wherever else. Run the setup.sh script to - you guessed it - set up!

Here's a few lists of stuff I like to have on my machines.

Essentials:
  - Chrome - log in for the chrome extensions
  - Lastpass
  - Divvy
  - Cloup App
  - Dropbox
  - ~~[Solarized][solarized-link]. I am now in love with solarized.~~
    - ~~For [sublime][sublime-solarized]~~
    - Edit: I am no longer in love with Solarized. It messed up sublime and the terminal.
  - these dotfiles
  - rvm
  - Homebrew (includes xcode)
  - VirtualBox
  - Vagrant (startup Vagrantfile included here)
  - Sublime Text
    - [Setup][sublime-link]
  - vim
  - ~~vim colorize (included in the dotfiles)~~

On Chrome:
  - Lastpass
  - ~~Ghostery~~
    - Edit: It turns out Ghostery is owned by an ad company. I now use Disconnect instead.
  - AdBlock Plus
  - Evernote Clipper

Extra:
  - Spotify
  - Skype
  - OpenEmu
  - iTerm2
  - Ansible
